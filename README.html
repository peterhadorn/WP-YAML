<h1>wp-yaml</h1>
<p>WP YAML is a lightweight, responsive, almost-blank Wordpress starter theme. It is meant to provide a clean starting base with a modular structure for rapid Wordpress website development, especially for developers who are familiar with SASS.</p>
<p>As the name implies, WP YAML is based on the awesome <a href="http://www.yaml.de">YAML CSS framework</a> and fully incorporates all of its wizardry.</p>

<h2>V0.2</h2>
<p>Version 0.2 is based on YAML 4.1.2 and fully incorporates YAML and the power of SASS. When YAML updates, you can simply update it in WP YAML as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy/update &#39;yaml-sass&#39; directory from new YAML release to wp-yaml/sass/yaml-sass/</li>
<li>copy/update &#39;lib&#39; directory to wp-yaml/lib/js/</li>
</ul>
<p>WP YAML currently uses the YAML full-page layout with responsive equal-heights grids. I plan to add more layout versions over time.</p>
<h2>Installation and Quick Start</h2>
<p>Install like any other Wordpress theme - upload /wp-yaml/ folder to /wp-content/themes/ and activate it in the back-end.</p>
<p>SASS developers can simply start adding their custom styling in /sass/_custom.scss, and/or edit the *.scss files in /sass/wpyaml/. The config.rb file is pre-configured for easy use of <a href="http://alphapixels.com/prepros/">Prepros</a> - just drop the wp-yaml directory in there if you don&#39;t like Compass and the command line :)</p>
<p>Plain CSS developers can edit css/style.css. </p>
