 *  YAML and WP YAML all come together in this style.scss, which compiles into css/style.css that is used in the template.
 * 
 * Plain CSS users can simply edit css/style.css as they like (it is supplied in uncompressed version).
 * 
 * The theme currently only uses a flexible grids full page layout. Different layout versions may be added in the future.
