 *  YAML, YAML 4 SASS and WP YAML all come together in this style.scss, which compiles into css/style.css that is used in the template.
 * 
 * Plain CSS users can simply rename css/style-cssplain.css to css/style.css and edit that file.
 * 
 * The theme currently only uses a flexible grids full page layout. Different layout versions may be added in the future.
